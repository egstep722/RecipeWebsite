        <h2> Health Need Changes </h2>
        <p class="lf"> As a vegetarian your nutrient intake is vastly different compared to those who eat meats, this means that many parts of our nutrient needs change with it. 
            Naturally this causes a natural decrease of your intake of b12, vitamin d, calcium, iron, and fatty acids like omega 3s as these foods are mostly found in meats. 
            So to healthily adjust to what our bodies crave in nutrients it is wise to eat foods that are high in these nutrients or take supplements if this isn't possible.

        <p class="lf">There are so many health benefits associated with a vegetarian lifestyle such as lower risk of cancer, lower blood pressure, often lower BMI, and even lower risk of 
        chronic disease. Many people do not realize that altough this lifestyle can be trying, it is often worth the cost.</p>
